LOG ISSUES FOR:

- Make banners transition to display block at mobile size (allow to grow in height)
- Responsive typography styles in the themes (instead of variant switching)
- Use datePicker control instead of plain text fields in admin dialogs
- Cache data in localstorage to initialize api services
- Enhance coupons to restrict to a package/user (start, end, minimum order, maximum order, user, quantity, applicable package)
- Set up cron job to back-up the database
