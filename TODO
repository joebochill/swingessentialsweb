Remaining Functionality

- Email communications in API
- Set up deployments in GH Actions (API and UI)
- Log back-end errors in the DB

Remaining Cleanup

- Back-up the database
- Standardize the error codes in the API (not all 400, 500, 200)

Final testing

- Verify functionality /error messages in staging environment
- Verify functionality / error messages in production environment
- Positive and negative test all major apis (registration, login, purchase, submit, respond)
- Check all empty states / initial states for new people

LOG ISSUES FOR:

- Make banners transition to display block at mobile size (allow to grow in height)
- Responsive typography styles in the themes (instead of variant switching)
- Use datePicker control instead of plain text fields in admin dialogs
- Cache data in localstorage to initialize api services
- Enhance coupons to restrict to a package/user (start, end, minimum order, maximum order, user, quantity, applicable package)
- Set up cron job to back-up the database
