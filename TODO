Remaining Functionality

- Email communications in API
- Set up deployments in GH Actions (API and UI)
    - [x] API
    - UI

Remaining Cleanup

- Implement the email sending functionality in API
- Set up staging deployments for UI
- Fix file location where the logger is logging (_logs)
- API is uploading files in a relative folder â€” needs fixed
- Move API secrets to ENV
- Standardize the error codes in the API (not all 400, 500, 200)
- Move ThemeToggleButton to separate file
- Extract the SIGN IN button to shared
- Set up husky to enforce prettier before commit
- Need to duplicate the swing videos and video_links in staging environment (no, just populate with some fake data)
- Back-up the database
- Set up prod deployments / pipelines


Final testing

- Verify functionality /error messages in staging environment
- Verify functionality / error messages in production environment
- Positive and negative test all major apis (registration, login, purchase, submit, respond)
- Check all empty states / initial states for new people

LOG ISSUES FOR:

- Make banners transition to display block at mobile size (allow to grow in height)
- Responsive typography styles in the themes (instead of variant switching)
- Use datePicker control instead of plain text fields in admin dialogs
- Cache data in localstorage to initialize api services
- Enhance coupons to restrict to a package/user (start, end, minimum order, maximum order, user, quantity, applicable package)
- Set up cron job to back-up the database
