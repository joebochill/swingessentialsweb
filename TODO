Remaining Cleanup

- Set up staging deployments for UI
- Back-up the database
- Set up prod deployments / pipelines
- Remove feature branches from deploy workflows
- Create a dev branch for api

Final testing

- Verify functionality /error messages in staging environment
- Verify functionality / error messages in production environment
- Positive and negative test all major apis (registration, login, purchase, submit, respond)
- Check all empty states / initial states for new people

LOG ISSUES FOR:

- Make banners transition to display block at mobile size (allow to grow in height)
- Responsive typography styles in the themes (instead of variant switching)
- Use datePicker control instead of plain text fields in admin dialogs
- Cache data in localstorage to initialize api services
- Enhance coupons to restrict to a package/user (start, end, minimum order, maximum order, user, quantity, applicable package)
- Set up cron job to back-up the database
